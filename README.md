# HW-Architecture

This project aims to build an SOC with all Open-source Peripheral and IP.
Also this project use Arm-training kit that is not use real-cpu.
This ARM Cortex-M3 CPU is modeling by SystemC and from ARM.
And this SOC's verification will use UVM for Sub-system/IP verification.
Of course, at SOC verification level as usual I use C/C++.

By referring to this projects, you will know how to build an SOC with some basic IPs and Peripherals.
Also how to construct the UVM environment from scratch.

Best REGARD, Mark
