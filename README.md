# HW-Architecture

This project aims to build an SOC with all Open-source Peripheral and IP.
Also this project use Arm-training kit that is not use real-cpu.
This Arm-CortexM3 CPU is modeling by SystemC and from ARM.
And this verification job will use UVM for Sub-system/IP verification.
At SOC level as usual I use C/C++.

By referring to this projects, you will know how to build an SOC with some basic IPs and Peripherals.
Also how to construct the UVM environment from scratch.
